# How it works
1. Drag and drop the "KV File Generator.py" file on to your desktop.
2. Start the program by double clicking on the file.
3. You will be asked to enter a map name. Type in your map name, and hit enter when you're done.
4. You will be asked to enter an author name. Type in your author name, and hit enter when you're done.
5. Choose between the options that will pop up. You can choose between 1-7.
6. Repeat this step, now with the counter terrorists.
7. You will see a preview of your configuration. Review it, and if you're satisfied with your settings, hit enter or type "y".
8. If you want to make changes, type "n", and the program will clear all settings you entered.

The file will be generated in the same directory the generator is, with the name of the map.
